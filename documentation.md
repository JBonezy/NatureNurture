# Project Documentation

## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Project Statement

**Problem Statement**:  
The agricultural sector faces significant threats from plant diseases that can severely reduce crop yields and impact food security. Farmers, particularly in rural or developing areas, often lack access to tools and education that can help them recognize plant infections early. This allows diseases to spread unchecked, leading to large-scale crop destruction. Misidentifying diseases can also lead to incorrect treatments, worsening the problem. This project aims to address these issues by developing an AI-driven solution that detects plant infections from images and provides timely diagnoses.

**Objectives**:
- Create an AI model capable of classifying 38 different plant infections based on leaf images.
- Provide actionable care and treatment advice through an AI chatbot.
- Make the solution accessible via mobile devices to benefit farmers directly in the field.

**Target Audience**:
- Farmers, particularly in regions where agricultural education is limited.
- Gardeners and plant enthusiasts looking to maintain plant health.

### 1.2 Proposed Solution

**Solution Overview**:  
This project offers an AI-powered tool that helps users identify plant diseases through image analysis. The AI model, trained on a dataset of images representing 38 different plant infections, processes an image of an infected plant leaf and identifies the disease. Additionally, an AI chatbot, powered by the **Gemini API**, offers personalized advice on how to treat the infection and care for the plant, empowering users to act promptly and effectively.

**Key Features**:
- **Image Classification**: The AI model classifies plant infections into one of 38 categories based on uploaded images.
- **AI Chatbot for Plant Care**: An integrated chatbot provides users with personalized plant care advice using the **Gemini API**.
- **Educational Information**: Detailed insights on the disease, including symptoms, prevention, and treatment methods, are available after diagnosis.
- **Accessibility**: Designed to be accessible on mobile platforms, the tool is practical for use directly in the field.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: An intuitive interface enables users to easily upload images, receive diagnoses, and interact with the AI chatbot for further guidance.

**Expected Impact**:
- **Early Detection**: Early diagnosis helps prevent the spread of plant diseases and improves crop yield management.
- **Increased Knowledge**: The AI chatbot educates users on how to treat and care for infected plants, increasing their knowledge of plant diseases.
- **Enhanced Food Security**: By minimizing the spread of diseases, the solution contributes to higher crop protection and food security.
- **Accessibility to Expert Knowledge**: The tool makes plant disease knowledge accessible to users who may not have easy access to agricultural experts.

### 1.3 Technical Aspects

**Programming Languages**:
- **Python**: Used for developing the machine learning model and handling backend processing.
- **JavaScript**: Employed in the front-end to handle user interaction with the AI model and chatbot.
- **HTML/CSS**: Utilized for creating a responsive and user-friendly web interface.

**Frameworks and Libraries**:
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: Used for building and training the deep learning model that classifies plant infections.
- **OpenCV**: For image preprocessing tasks like resizing, augmentation, and transformation before feeding images into the model.
- **Gemini API**: Powers the AI chatbot, providing users with tailored advice on how to care for and treat their plants.
- **Flask/Django**: (Optional) Web frameworks that can be used to serve the machine learning model and manage API interactions.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Used to visualize model performance and display accuracy and loss graphs during training.
